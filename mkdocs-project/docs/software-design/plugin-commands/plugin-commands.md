# Plugin Commands #

Plugin commands are a feature that is under development.
The design is being determined in TSTool and may be implemented in StateDMI.
The purpose of plugin commands is to let StateDMI run third-part commands that are loaded from Jar files at runtime,
rather than being distributed with the core software.
More information will be added here later.
