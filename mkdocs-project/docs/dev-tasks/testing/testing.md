StateDMI testing relies on extensive functional tests.

* See the [cdss-app-statedmi-test test repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-app-statedmi-test)
**This is proposed - for now, refer to the files under `test/regression` folder in the `cdss-app-statedmi-main` repository.**
* See the [Quality Control](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss-app-statedmi-doc-user/quality-control/quality-control/) chapter of the StateDMI documentation.
**This documentation has not yet been converted to online form.**
