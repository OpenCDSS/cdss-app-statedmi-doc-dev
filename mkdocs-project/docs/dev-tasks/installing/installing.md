------------

## Install on Windows ##

The installer program can be run on Windows to install StateDMI on a computer for each user.
StateDMI will install in a new folder such as `C:\CDSS\StateDMI-04.05.00` for each version.
This ensures that users can run different versions of StateDMI needed for specific projects and processes.
See the [StateDMI Installation and Configuration Appendix](https://opencdss.state.co.us/statedmi/latest/doc-user/appendix-install/install/).

## Install on Linux ##

It is possible to install StateDMI on Linux.
However, this has not been a priority and documentation has not been prepared.
