# StateDMI / Development Tasks / Overview #

Development tasks are the day-to-day work that a software developer does to enhance StateDMI software
to add new functionality, fix bugs, etc.
This documentation describes common tasks, roughly in the order from design to deployment.
Documentation for these is similar to other CDSS software tools such as TSTool.

* [OpenCDSS Coordination](opencdss-coord/opencdss-coord.md) - how to coordinate StateDMI development within OpenCDSS
* [Run Eclipse](run-eclipse/run-eclipse.md) - how to start Eclipse
* [Designing Software](designing-software/designing-software.md) - understanding the StateDMI software design
* [Version Control with Git](version-control/version-control.md) - how should developers do branch, merge, commit messages, tags, etc.
* [Documenting](documenting/documenting.md) - how developers should document code, API, create developer and user documentation
* [Troubleshooting Eclipse](troubleshooting-eclipse/troubleshooting-eclipse.md) - figuring out why Eclipse is not working, and responding to Eclipse errors (beyond code syntax errors)
* [Coding](coding/coding.md) - Java coding information
* [Compiling](compiling/compiling.md) - compiling the software
* [Running](running/running.md) - running the software
* [Testing](testing/testing.md) - how to automate StateDMI code testing
* [Deploying](deploying/deploying.md) - building an installer and deploying an operational StateDMI
* [Installing](installing/installing.md) - installing StateDMI in a development environment
