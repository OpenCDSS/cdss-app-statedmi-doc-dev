# StateDMI / Development Tasks / Designing Software #

Software should be designed consistent with StateDMI design standards.
StateDMI is complex.  It is generally best to follow past design patterns while
evolving old code to new designs when improvements are identified.

* See the [Software Design](../../software-design/overview.md) reference section.
