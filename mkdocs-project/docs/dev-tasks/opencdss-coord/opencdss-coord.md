# StateDMI / Development Tasks / OpenCDSS Coordination #

StateDMI software has been funded to a large extent by the State of Colorado as part of
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems](https://cdss.colorado.gov/).
The Open Water Foundation migrated StateDMI and other CDSS software to open source projects
and continues to provide support.
Activities to implement open source projects include the following:

1.  Selecting and implementing open source licenses.
2.  Managing software in GitHub in the [State of Colorado's OpenCDSS](https://github.com/OpenCDSS) account.
3.  Updating the development environment and associated documentation.
4.  Working with State of Colorado to implement full open source projects with appropriate
    staffing and governance.
